## Overview
TPF is a structured personal life operating system designed to apply engineering principles to daily management. It aims to optimize executive function challenges (specifically ADHD) not by simplifying life, but by creating a rigorous, data-driven environment that supports analytical decision-making.

This repository hosts the digital implementation of the **Tactical Planning Framework (TPF) v1.0**.

> **Note:** This documentation outlines the system architecture and philosophy. It is not a user manual or a finalized Software Requirements Specification (SRS). The framework is subject to iterative updates.

## 🧠 Philosophy & Motivation

This project was born from a specific need: **Optimizing an ADHD mind that thrives on complexity rather than simplicity.**

While traditional advice suggests minimizing planning for ADHD, TPF takes the opposite approach: **Hyper-Systematization.** The goal is to externalize memory and logic into a reliable system.

### Key Objectives:
1.  **Analytical Decision Making:** Removing emotional bias from daily choices by relying on a strict algorithmic base.
2.  **Protection Against Manipulation:** Systematizing human profiling (via the Diamond System) to evaluate relationships objectively, serving as a firewall against social manipulation.
3.  **Permanent Lesson Retention:** Ensuring that "Observations" and "Lessons Learned" are never lost, but stored as permanent data points.
4.  **Extreme Efficiency via Automation:** Reducing weekly planning overhead from **3+ hours to ~10 minutes**. The system handles the heavy lifting of task distribution automatically.

## Core Architecture

### 1. Realism Point (RP) Algorithm
A quantitative metric to assess schedule feasibility and prevent burnout.
$$RP = \frac{\text{Total Required Time (RT)}}{\text{Available Free Time}}$$
* **RP < 0.8:** Optimal Load
* **RP > 1.0:** System Overload (Triggers CWA protocols or rescheduling)

### 2. Auto-Distribution Engine ("The Smoothing Logic")
An algorithmic approach that automatically allocates tasks to daily slots to minimize peaks.
* **Time Smoothing:** Applies the formula $Daily Allocation = \frac{RT}{Available Days}$ to spread load evenly.
* **Atomic vs. Divisible:**
    * **Divisible (Default):** Tasks are split into smaller chunks (min. 5 mins) across multiple days.
    * **Atomic:** Tasks marked as "Non-dividable" (e.g., Exams, Meetings) reserve continuous time blocks.

### 3. Graph-Based Dependency System
Unlike linear to-do lists, TPF utilizes an **N-to-N dependency graph**.
* **Complex Blocking:** Task X can be a prerequisite for Task Y and Z simultaneously.
* **Level Agnostic:** Dependencies are independent of Importance Levels (IL). A Level 3 task (e.g., "Buy batteries") can block a Level 1 task (e.g., "Final Exam").

### 4. Impulse Control Pipeline
Implements a "Pre-Preparation" layer. Observations are captured but locked behind a mandatory **2-day buffer period** before they can be processed into actionable tasks or entities.

### 5. The Diamond System
A hierarchical, relational model for managing personal and professional entities based on calculated Evaluation Points (EP).

## Tech Stack

The project utilizes a feature-based architecture with a focus on data integrity and relational mapping.

* **Frontend:** React.js (Vite), Tailwind CSS
* **Backend:** Java Spring Boot (REST API)
* **Database:** PostgreSQL (Recursive Schema for Tasks, Relational for Entities)
* **Caching:** Redis (Planned for RP calculation optimization)
* **Infrastructure:** Docker (Containerization)

## Roadmap & Current Status

The project is currently in the **Alpha** development phase.

- [x] **Frontend Architecture:** React implementation of Dashboard, Diamond View, and Task Trees.
- [x] **Database Schema:** PostgreSQL ERD design (Recursive Tasks, Entity Relations).
